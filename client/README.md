Task Overview
The candidate must implement a user authentication system where users can sign up and log in. Upon successful authentication, users will be redirected to the dashboard. The authentication process should be simple yet secure, ensuring that only logged-in users can access the dashboard features.

The dashboard will interact with a public API of your choice to fetch product data dynamically. You are expected to implement state management to ensure smooth data handling across different components of the application.

Key Features to Implement
Once authenticated, the logged-in user should be able to:
✅ View Products – Display a list of products retrieved from the public API of your choice.
✅ Filter Products – Implement filtering options in your products
✅ Order Products – Allow users to place orders for products, and ensure that ordered products are stored for later reference.
✅ View Ordered Products – Users should be able to see a list of the products they have ordered.
✅ Download Ordered Reports – Provide a functionality where users can download a report of their ordered products combined with their pricing.

Candidates are encouraged to use best practices in state management, API handling, and UI/UX design to ensure a seamless experience. The project should demonstrate an understanding of CRUD operations where applicable, with a focus on handling real-time data updates from the API.
